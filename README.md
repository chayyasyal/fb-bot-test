# Facebook Messenger Bot Test
I am building a bot, as part of a BBC test project, using Facebook Messenger. I have used JavaScript and Node to achieve the latter.

# How to use
node index.js

# Challenges with code
I have been having issues with the server. In Node terminal I have been seeing 502 Bad Gateway error messages and Facebook webhooks is not recognising the URL I have gotten from Node.
I am trying to fix this.
